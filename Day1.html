WELCOME TO DAY ONE OF HUSBANDMAS MY LOVE <br>
FOR THE FIRST DAY OF HUSBANDMAS I WANNA TELL U A STORY <br><br>
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A HANDSOME LINK <br>
WHO LIVED IN A BIG CASTLE <br>
AND EVERYONE WOULD STOP AND STARE AT HIS HANDSOMENESS <br>
AND HE WAS MARRIED TO HIS BEAUTIFUL HUSBAND<br>
<br>
Lol no but seriously husband I remember when we first met <br>
And like omg u were so funny and just always made me so happy <br>
And I genuinely fell in love with you so fast omg ur just so mwah <br>
I love you so much but like omg we called so much one day and I dreamed about you <br>
And that was the best day EVERRRRRRR <br>
I love you so much my handsomest husband ever<br><br>
I think ur rly amazing and I'd love you no matter what and honestly ur so amazing <br>
I just wanna spend the rest of my life with u <br><br>
MWAHHHHHH <br>
